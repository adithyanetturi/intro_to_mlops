Iris Classification Model with MLflow


This repository contains a classification model built using the popular Iris dataset from sklearn, showcasing machine learning experimentation with MLflow. This project provides an end-to-end walkthrough of data preprocessing, model training, and performance tracking using MLflow, a powerful tool for managing machine learning lifecycles.

Project Overview


The objective of this project is to classify iris flowers into species based on sepal and petal measurements. Using MLflow, I have explored various model versions, hyperparameters, and metrics tracking to optimize model performance and make results reproducible.

Features
MLflow Integration:

Tracks all experimental runs, including model parameters, metrics, and artifacts.
Easily compare performance between different versions of the model.
Convenient UI to visualize model metrics and download artifacts for further analysis.
Model Training and Experimentation:

Employed the sklearn package to build and evaluate a classification model using the Iris dataset.
Experimented with different model versions, tracking their performance metrics in MLflow.
Dataset:

The Iris dataset from sklearn provides a simple yet effective dataset for classification tasks.
Includes 150 samples with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Getting Started
Requirements
Python 3.7+
Libraries: sklearn, mlflow
